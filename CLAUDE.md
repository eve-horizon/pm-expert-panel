# Eden — AI-First Requirements Platform

## What This Is

A full-stack Eve Horizon application: NestJS API + React SPA + PostgreSQL database + Eden CLI + 16 AI agents. Users interact via Slack (`@eve pm`) or the web UI. The expert panel reviews documents, the intelligence layer keeps the story map alive, and the web app renders it all as an interactive grid.

## Agents (16 total)

| Agent | Slug | Type | Role |
|-------|------|------|------|
| PM Coordinator | `pm` | routable | Triage, file processing, panel dispatch, synthesis |
| Tech Lead | `tech-lead` | expert panel | Technical feasibility, architecture |
| UX Advocate | `ux-advocate` | expert panel | UX, accessibility, i18n |
| Business Analyst | `biz-analyst` | expert panel | Process flows, success criteria |
| GTM Advocate | `gtm-advocate` | expert panel | Revenue, competitive positioning |
| Risk Assessor | `risk-assessor` | expert panel | Timeline, dependency, regulatory risk |
| QA Strategist | `qa-strategist` | expert panel | Test strategy, edge cases |
| Devil's Advocate | `devils-advocate` | expert panel | Challenge assumptions |
| Extraction | `extraction` | pipeline | Identify requirements from extracted content |
| Synthesis | `synthesis` | pipeline | Compare with map, create changeset |
| Map Chat | `map-chat` | intelligence | Conversational map editing |
| Alignment | `alignment` | intelligence | Post-changeset conflict/gap scan |
| Question Triage | `question-triage` | intelligence | Fast answer classification (needs_changes vs informational) |
| Question Agent | `question-agent` | intelligence | Answer -> map change evaluation |
| Map Generator | `map-generator` | wizard | Generate initial story map from project description |

Note: The Ingestion agent (`ingestion`) is defined in agents.yaml but content extraction is handled by the Eve platform's ingest service. The extraction agent receives the extracted text.

## Event-Driven Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Steps | Effect |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| ingestion-pipeline | `doc.ingest` | extract -> synthesize | Creates changeset from document |
| alignment-check | `changeset.accepted` | align | Creates questions for conflicts/gaps |
| question-evolution | `question.answered` | triage -> evolve (conditional) | Fast classify, then create changeset if needed |

The question-evolution workflow uses a two-step pattern: `question-triage` classifies the answer as `needs_changes` or `informational`. Only `needs_changes` triggers the heavier `question-agent`.

## Database (PostgreSQL 16)

19 tables with RLS (org-scoped isolation):

**Story Map:** projects, personas, activities, steps, tasks, step_tasks, releases
**Intelligence:** questions, question_references, ingestion_sources, reviews, expert_opinions
**Changesets:** changesets, changeset_items (with approval_status for two-stage review)
**Collaboration:** project_members (owner/editor/viewer), project_invites, map_views, notifications
**Audit:** audit_log (immutable, append-only)

Every query runs in a transaction with `SET LOCAL app.org_id`. RLS policies enforce scope.

## Key Patterns

- **Changeset model** — All AI-proposed changes go through changesets with per-item accept/reject
- **Staged council** — Coordinator first, experts fan out only when needed
- **RLS at query time** — `app.org_id` set per-transaction, policies enforce isolation
- **Dual auth** — Eve SSO (users) + Eve job tokens (agents), normalized to `req.user`
- **Display IDs** — Human-readable refs (TSK-1.2.1, ACT-3, Q-5) used across agents and UI
- **CLI-first agents** — All agents access Eden through the `eden` CLI, never raw REST
- **Inline skill templates** — Agent SKILL.md files must keep structural templates (JSON schemas, changeset shapes) inline, not behind file pointers — agents skip or misread reference files
- **Two-step triage** — Cheap classifier before expensive agent (question-triage -> question-agent)
- **Changeset contract** — Canonical Zod schema in `apps/api/src/contracts/` defines the changeset shape; skills reference the exported JSON schema

## CRITICAL: Deploying to Staging

**Every deploy MUST sync the manifest first.** The platform stores the manifest server-side and uses the latest version for routing decisions (pipeline vs direct deploy). If the manifest is stale, deploys will fail with "Manifest missing services" or route incorrectly.

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS sync manifest before deploying (from the eden repo root)
eve project sync

# 2. Deploy using --repo-dir to auto-sync and deploy in one step
eve env deploy sandbox --ref <sha> --repo-dir .

# 3. Or deploy HEAD (sync resolves the ref)
eve env deploy sandbox --ref HEAD --repo-dir .
```

**Why `--repo-dir .` matters:** Without it, the CLI fetches the latest manifest hash from the server — which may be stale or from a different sync. With `--repo-dir .`, the CLI reads your local `.eve/manifest.yaml`, syncs it to the server, and uses the fresh hash. This prevents the manifest/commit mismatch that causes deploy failures.

**The deploy pipeline does:** build -> release -> deploy -> migrate -> smoke-test -> smoke-test-p2

**After deploy, verify:**
```bash
curl -sI https://eden.eh1.incept5.dev  # Alias URL (should be 200)
curl -sI https://web.incept5-eden-sandbox.eh1.incept5.dev  # Standard URL
```

## Key Commands

```bash
# Local dev
docker-compose up -d              # Postgres + migrations
cd apps/api && npm run start:dev  # API on :3000
cd apps/web && npm run dev        # Web on :5175, proxy /api -> :3000

# Eve agent sync (after changing agents/teams/chat config)
eve project sync                  # Sync manifest to platform
eve agents sync --local --allow-dirty  # Sync agent configs

# Staging deploy (ALWAYS use --repo-dir .)
eve env deploy sandbox --ref HEAD --repo-dir .

# Smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-test-local-p2.sh  # Local
./scripts/smoke-test.sh           # Staging

# Changeset contract
npm run generate:contracts --prefix apps/api  # Regenerate contract JSON
./scripts/check-contract-drift.sh             # Verify no drift
```

## Conventions

- Agent persona/behavior -> `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Agent definitions -> `eve/agents.yaml`
- Database schema -> `db/migrations/` (immutable once created)
- Only the coordinator is gateway-routable; all others are internal
- Slug: lowercase alphanumeric + dashes, org-unique
- **Never edit existing migrations.** Create a new migration file with the next timestamp.
- **Inline skill templates.** Agent SKILL.md files must keep JSON schemas and changeset shapes inline in the prompt — agents skip or misread reference files behind pointers.

## Editing Guidelines

- **Agent behavior** -> Edit `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **New agent** -> Update `eve/agents.yaml`, `eve/teams.yaml` (if team member), create `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`
- **Harness config** -> Edit `eve/x-eve.yaml`
- **API endpoint** -> Add module in `apps/api/src/<name>/`, register in `app.module.ts`
- **API/CLI parity** -> Every non-webhook REST route must have `eden` CLI coverage. If you add, change, or remove an API endpoint, update `cli/src/commands/*` in the same change and keep docs/tests aligned.
- **Web page** -> Add page in `apps/web/src/pages/`, add route in `App.tsx`
- **Database** -> New migration file in `db/migrations/` (never edit existing ones)
- **Changeset schema** -> Edit `apps/api/src/contracts/create-changeset.contract.ts`, run `generate:contracts`, update inline templates in affected SKILL.md files
- After agent config changes -> `eve agents sync`

## Testing Strategy

**Two-tier verification:**

1. **Local Docker** — DB migrations, API CRUD, changeset apply, UI rendering. No Eve needed.
2. **Staging Sandbox** — Chat routing, SSE streaming, agent workflows, event-triggered pipelines.

Don't build local mocks of Eve infrastructure — test the real thing on staging.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
